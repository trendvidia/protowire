# Umbrella tracking issue — paste-ready

This file contains the paste-ready body for the umbrella tracking issue
for **Protowire Schema Extensions** (RFC-001, targeting protowire v1.2.0).

**How to use:**

1. Open a new issue in the `trendvidia/protowire` tracker.
2. Suggested title:
   `[META] Protowire Schema Extensions (v1.2.0) — RFC-001`
3. Suggested labels: `meta`, `schema-extensions`, `tracking`
4. Paste the content below the `--- begin paste ---` marker.
5. As child issues are filed in their respective trackers, replace the
   `#TBD` placeholders with the real issue numbers (and repo paths,
   since several issues live in repos other than `protowire`).

The body below renders cleanly in both GitHub Issues and Linear.

# Protowire Schema Extensions (v1.2.0) — RFC-001

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft — RFC awaiting ratification |
| **Target spec version** | protowire v1.2.0 (strictly additive minor) |
| **IETF draft** | `draft-trendvidia-protowire-01` (in preparation) |
| **Driving design doc** | [RFC-001](docs/RFC-001-schema-extensions.md) |
| **Implementation issues** | [RFC-001-issues.md](docs/RFC-001-issues.md) |
| **Conformance fixtures** | [`testdata/schema-extensions/`](testdata/schema-extensions/) |

## Overview

This umbrella tracks the v1.2.0 protowire schema-extension work — three
new top-level declarations (`type`, `function`, `annotation`), a
unified `@annotation(...)` use-site syntax, and a structured validation
error model. The additions promote message validation to a first-class
schema concern.

All additions are **strictly additive**: every schema valid under v1.1
remains valid under v1.2. Wire formats (PXF, PB, SBE, envelope) are
unchanged. The new constructs lower to standard `FileDescriptorSet`
plus custom-option carriers in extension numbers `50400`–`50404`
(reserved in [`STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md)), so existing tooling
round-trips them transparently.

Per-port adoption is independent. Reference Go implementation lands
across `protocompile`, `protocheck`, `protolsp`, `protobuf-go` (custom
fork), and `pxfed`; other ports follow once the Go reference is proven.

## How to participate

- **Want the design context?** Start with [RFC-001](docs/RFC-001-schema-extensions.md).
- **Want to implement something?** Open the corresponding child issue and check its "Implementation notes" section in [RFC-001-issues.md](docs/RFC-001-issues.md) — each enriched issue has file-level entry points.
- **Have a design question?** Comment on the matching open-question issue above, or open a new one with the `schema-extensions` and `design` labels and link it here.
- **Found a bug?** Open against the implementing repo (e.g., `protocompile` for parser bugs, `protocheck` for runtime bugs); reference this umbrella for context.

## Maintainer notes

- **Backward compatibility.** v1.2 is strictly additive on the v1.0 spec-freeze line. The only soft-break is the new reserved keywords (`type`, `function`, `annotation`, `expression`, `this`) — application schemas using any of these as message/oneof/enum-value identifiers must rename. Document and search for this in any consumer that lints schemas.
- **Extension number range.** Reservation is `50400`–`50499` for schema-extension carriers. `50400`–`50404` are allocated (the `50100`–`50101` block is skipped because SBE already uses it on `FileOptions`). Allocations beyond this range MUST go through an RFC update; renumbering is a wire break.
- **Per-port adoption is decoupled.** A port at v1.1 reading a v1.2 schema rejects the new keywords at parse time. A port at v1.2 reading a v1.1 schema accepts it unchanged. Schemas pin to the highest minor they use; consumers must match.
- **Ratification gate.** This issue moves from `Draft` to `Active` once RFC-001 has at least one approving review from spec governance AND all open-question issues are either resolved or filed with a `v1.2 deferred` label.
